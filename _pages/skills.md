## 🎓 My Background

During my studies in the BUT Networks & Telecommunications program at IUT de Luminy, I acquired strong skills in networking, notably through configuring Cisco equipment, discovering programming, and learning about system security.

I am currently preparing to enter my third year as a work-study student, in order to consolidate my technical knowledge and apply it in a professional environment.
